Problem Statement
Develop an app which will display real time updated Covid_19 data all across the world.

Introduction
The world has been shocked by Covid_19 virus. We have gone through immense lockdown. There is a curiosity in people to know the cases data in their country or worldwide.
I have developed an app Covid_19_Tracker which will display the data of countries with active cases, Total cases, Total deaths, Todayâ€™s cases and deaths and other information.
